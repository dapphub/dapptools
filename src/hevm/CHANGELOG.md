- `bytesX` arguments to `hevm abiencode` are automatically padded

### Fixed

- Test contracts with no code (e.g. `abstract` contracts) are now skipped
- Replay data for invariant tests is now displayed in a form that does not cause errors when used with `dapp test --replay`

## [0.48.1] - 2021-09-08

### Added

- Support for 0.8.4 custom error types in stack traces

### Changed

- Contract feching happens synchronously again.
- Invariants checked before calling methods from targetContracts.

### Fixed

## 0.48.0 - 2021-08-03

### Changed

- Updated to London hard fork!
- The configuration variable `DAPP_TEST_BALANCE_CREATE` has been renamed to `DAPP_TEST_BALANCE`
- Default `smttimeout` has been increased to 1 minute.
- A new flag has been added to hevm (`--ask-smt-iterations`) that controls the number of iterations
  at which the symbolic execution engine will stop eager evaluation and begin to query the smt
  solver whether a given branch is reachable or not.
- Contract fetching now happens asynchronously.
- Fixed no contract definition crashes
- Removed NoSuchContract failures

## 0.47.0 - 2021-07-01

### Added

- A new test runner for checking invariants against random reachable contract states.
- `hevm symbolic` can search for solc 0.8 style assertion violations, and a new `--assertions` flag
  has been added allowing users to customize which assertions should be reported
- A new cheatcode `ffi(string[])` that executes an arbitrary command in the system shell

### Changed

- Z3 is once again the default smt solver
- Updated nixpkgs to the `21.05` channel

### Fixed

- Sourcemaps for contracts containing `immutable` are now shown in the debug view.

## 0.46.0 - 2021-04-29

### Added

- Updated to Berlin! Conformant with GeneralStateTests at commit hash `644967e345bbc6642fab613e1b1737abbe131f78`.

### Fixed

- ADDMOD and MULMOD by zero yields zero.
- Address calculation for newly created contracts.
- Accomodated for the notorious "anomolies on the main network" (see yellow paper Appendix K for trivia)
- A hevm crash when debugging a SELFDESTRUCT contract.

## 0.45.0 - 2021-03-22

### Added

- Two new cheatcodes were added: `sign(uint sk, bytes message)` and `addr(uint sk)`. Taken together
  these should allow for much more ergonomic testing of code that handles signed messages.
- Symbolic execution can deal with partially symbolic bytecode, allowing for symbolic constructor arguments to be given in tests.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the abiencoding.
- Fixed the range being generated by ints.
- `hevm flatten` combines the SPDX license identifiers of all source files.

### Changed

- updated `nixpkgs` to the `20.09` channel

## 0.44.1 - 2020-02-02

### Changed

- hevm cheatcodes now accept symbolic arguments, allowing e.g. symbolic jumps in time in unit tests
- More efficient arithmetic overflow checks by translating queries to a more [intelligent form](www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/z3prefix.pdf).

## 0.44.0 - 2020-01-26

### Added

- `hevm` now accepts solidity json output built via `--standard-json` as
  well as `--combined-json`.
- addresses in the trace output are prefixed with `ContractName@0x...`
  if there is a corresponding contract and `@0x...` otherwise.

### Fixed

- Symbolic execution now generates calldata arguments restricted to the proper ranges,
  following the semantics of fuzzing.
- If the `--address` flag is present in `hevm exec` or `hevm symbolic`,
  it overrides the contract address at which a contract will be created.
- Address pretty printing
- Updated sbv to `8.9.5` to fix "non-const in array declaration" cvc4 issue with ds-test.

### Changed

- Use cvc4 as default smt solver

- `hevm dapp-test` now supports symbolic execution of test methods that are prefixed with `prove` or `proveFail`
- The `hevm interactive` alias has been removed, as it is equivalent to `hevm dapp-test --debug`
- `hevm dapp-test --match` now matches on contract name and file path, as well as test name
- Step through the callstack in debug mode using the arrow keys

### Changed

- `dapp-test` trace output now detects ds-note events and shows `LogNote`
- create addresses are shown with `@<address>` in the trace
- `DSTest.setUp()` is only run if it exists, rather than failing
- support new ds-test `log_named_x(string, x)` (previously bytes32 keys)
- return arguments are fully displayed in the trace (previously only a single word)
- return/revert trace will now show the correct source position

## 0.42.0 - 2020-10-31

### Changed

- z3 updated to 4.8.8
- optimize SMT queries
- More useful trace output for unknown calls
- Default to on chain values for `coinbase`, `timestamp`, `difficulty`, `blocknumber` when rpc is provided
- Perform tx initialization (gas payment, value transfer) in `hevm exec`, `hevm symbolic` and `hevm dapp-test`.

### Added

- TTY commands `P` and `c-p` for taking larger steps backwards in the debuger.
- `--cache` flag for `dapp-test`, `exec`, `symbolic`, `interactive`,
  enabling caching of contracts received by rpc.

## 0.41.0 - 2020-08-19

### Changed

- Switched to [PVP](https://github.com/haskell/pvp/blob/master/pvp-faq.md) for version control, starting now at `0.41.0` (MAJOR.MAJOR.MINOR).
- z3 updated to 4.8.7
- Generate more interesting values in property based testing,
  and implement proper shrinking for all abi values.
- Fixed soundness bug when using KECCAK or SHA256 opcode/precompile
- Fixed an issue in debug mode where backstepping could cause path information to be forgotten
- Ensure that pathconditions are consistent when branching, and end the execution with VMFailure: DeadPath if this is not the case
- Fixed a soundness bug where nonzero jumpconditions were assumed to equal one.
- default `--smttimeout` changed from unlimited to 20 seconds
- `hevm symbolic --debug` now respects `--max-iterations`

### Added

- `hevm exec --trace` flag to dump a trace
- Faster backstepping in interactive mode by saving multiple snapshot states.
- Support for symbolic storage for multiple contracts

## 0.40 - 2020-07-22

- hevm is now capable of symbolic execution!

### Changed

As a result, the types of several registers of the EVM have changed to admit symbolic values as well as concrete ones.

- state.stack: `Word` -> `SymWord`.
- state.memory: `ByteString` -> `[SWord 8]`.
- state.callvalue: `W256` -> `SymWord`.
- state.caller: `Addr` -> `SAddr`.
- state.returndata: `ByteString` -> `[SWord 8]`.
- state.calldata: `ByteString` -> `([SWord 8], (SWord 32))`. The first element is a list of symbolic bytes, the second is the length of calldata. We have `fst calldata !! i .== 0` for all `snd calldata < i`.

- tx.value: `W256` -> `SymWord`.

- contract.storage: `Map Word Word` -> `Storage`, defined as:

```hs
data Storage
  = Concrete (Map Word SymWord)
  | Symbolic (SArray (WordN 256) (WordN 256))
  deriving (Show)
```

### Added

New cli commands:

- `hevm symbolic`: search for assertion violations, or step through a symbolic execution in debug mode.
- `hevm equivalence`: compare two programs for equivalence.

See the README for details on usage.

The new module `EVM.SymExec` exposes several library functions dealing with symbolic execution.
In particular,

- `SymExec.interpret`: implements an operational monad script similar to `TTY.interpret` and `Stepper.interpret`, but returns a list of final VM states rather than a single VM.
- `SymExec.verify`: takes a prestate and a postcondition, symbolically executes the prestate and checks that all final states matches the postcondition.

### Removed

The concrete versions of a lot of arithmetic operations, replaced with their more general symbolic counterpart.

## 0.39 - 2020-07-13

- Exposes abi encoding to cli
- Added cheat code `hevm.store(address a, bytes32 location, bytes32 value)`
- Removes `ExecMode`, always running as `ExecuteAsBlockchainTest`. This means that `hevm exec` now finalizes transactions as well.
- `--code` is now entirely optional. Not supplying it returns an empty contract, or whatever is stored in `--state`.

## 0.38 - 2020-04-23

- Exposes metadata stripping of bytecode to the cli: `hevm strip-metadata --code X`. [357](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/pull/357).

- Make InvalidTx a fatal error for vm tests and ci.
- Suport property based testing in unit tests. [313](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/pull/313) Arguments to test functions are randomly generated based on the function abi. Fuzz tests are not present in the graphical debugger.
- Added flags `--replay` and `--fuzz-run` to `hevm dapp-test`, allowing for particular fuzz run cases to be rerun, or for configuration of how many fuzz tests are run.
- Correct gas readouts for unit tests
- Prevent crash when trying to jump to next source code point if source code is missing
