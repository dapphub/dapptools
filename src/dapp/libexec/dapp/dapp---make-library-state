# First, to support library linking, we build up a "state directory"
# that contains the initial deployed contracts.  This way we can
# directly put code at arbitrary addresses, which is how we fake the
# deployed libraries.
#
# Funnily enough, Hevm loads state directories not from the file
# system directly, but via Git.  Because these state directories are
# ephemeral, it adds some complexity to this script: we create a
# one-commit Git repository, run the tests, then delete it.
#
# (The state directory support of Hevm is made to allow persistence.
# That's why we use Git repositories: to get atomic behavior and also
# history tracking.)
